# Smite Meta
***Smite Meta***â„¢ is a simple to use resource for players of all experience levels.

### Main site features:
  - Create custom or get suggested builds
  - Create your profile and save your favorite builds to it
  - See your build's final stats on the god of your choosing (level 20 stats)
  - Find out what the pros are doing and learn from them
  - Read up on god info and see which gods are most popular currently

The overall objective of Smite Meta is to make the game easier for beginner players and to help more experienced players keep up with the changes to the game smoothly. 

Your saved builds will be updated automatically at every patch to ensure the final stats are always accurate with the current game.

We will keep a log of a few famous/pro players and what they are building/what gods they are playing most, so you can it out yourself without having to fast-forward through a 45 minute YouTube video.

MOBAs have a natural learning curve that is **very** steep due to the amount of information in the game. This makes them both amazing to play and extremely difficult for newbies. We are hoping our efforts here will at minimum ease that burden by giving you the answers you need about Smite within 3 clicks.

Have fun and remember gaming should always be fun!

Good luck!
